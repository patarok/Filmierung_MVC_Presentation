# Filmierung_MVC_Presentation

This is just a neat little project to show, 
that it is not so much of a problem, to implement a nice Reveal.JS 
presentation in some sleak looking ASP.NET MVC-Framework-Project.
It also served for a presentation for my internal degree-application audit,
and its topic was the architectural MVC pattern.
Thanks for useful tipps on JS and differences in URL adressing
go to Michael Palkovics, and Dennis Pavitschitz.
